    """
    The same as scipy.ndimage.morphology.distance_transform_edt but
    using float32 and better memory cleaning internally.

    In addition to the distance transform, the feature transform can
    be calculated. In this case the index of the closest background
    element is returned along the first axis of the result.
    Parameters
    ----------
    input : array_like
        Input data to transform. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: 1 wherever input equates to True, 0 elsewhere.
    sampling : float or int, or sequence of same, optional
        Spacing of elements along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of
        length equal to the input rank; if a single number, this is used for
        all axes. If not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.
    return_distances : bool, optional
        Whether to return distance matrix. At least one of
        return_distances/return_indices must be True. Default is True.
    return_indices : bool, optional
        Whether to return indices matrix. Default is False.
    distances : ndarray, optional
        Used for output of distance array, must be of type float64.
    indices : ndarray, optional
        Used for output of indices, must be of type int32.
    Returns
    -------
    distance_transform_edt : ndarray or list of ndarrays
        Either distance matrix, index matrix, or a list of the two,
        depending on `return_x` flags and `distance` and `indices`
        input parameters.
    Notes
    -----
    The euclidean distance transform gives values of the euclidean
    distance::
                    n
      y_i = sqrt(sum (x[i]-b[i])**2)
                    i
    where b[i] is the background point (value 0) with the smallest
    Euclidean distance to input points x[i], and n is the
    number of dimensions.

    s2
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    voxelspacing
        The voxelspacing in a distance unit i.e. spacing of elements
        along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of length equal to
        the input rank; if a single number, this is used for all axes. If
        not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.

    Returns
    -------
        The distances from all non-zero object(s) in ```s1``` to the nearest
        non zero object(s) in ```s2```. The distance unit is the same as for
        the spacing of elements along each dimension, which is usually given in
        mm.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is not symmetric.

    For determining the contours, the border handling from ITK relies on
    `ZeroFluxNeumannBoundaryCondition`, which equals `nearest` mode in scipy.

    """
    Computes the (symmetric) Mean Contour Distance between the binary objects
    in two images. It is defined as the maximum average surface distance
    between the objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    s2
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted

    voxelspacing
        The voxelspacing in a distance unit i.e. spacing of elements
        along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of length equal to
        the input rank; if a single number, this is used for all axes. If
        not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.

    Returns
    -------
        The symmetric Mean Contour Distance between the object(s) in ```s1```
        and the object(s) in ```s2```. The distance unit is the same as for the
        spacing of elements along each dimension, which is usually given in mm.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a real metric that mimics the ITK MeanContourDistanceFilter.

        The neighbourhood/connectivity considered when determining the surface
